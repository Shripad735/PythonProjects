# Code Explanation

The code first imports the turtle, random, and winsound modules. The turtle module is used to create the turtle graphics, the random module is used to generate a random number for the dice roll, and the winsound module is used to play a sound when a player wins.

The code then creates a screen and two turtles, one for each player. The turtles are placed at the starting positions and given a pink and yellow color, respectively.

A list of numbers from 1 to 6 is created to represent the possible dice rolls. A for loop is then used to iterate 20 times. On each iteration, the code checks if either turtle has reached the finish line. If so, the game is over and the winning turtle is announced. Otherwise, the code prompts the user to press enter to roll the dice for each player. The dice output is then generated randomly and the turtle corresponding to the player is moved forward or backward, depending on the dice output.

The code also plays a sound when a player wins.
