The player enters their name.

The game starts in a loop where the player encounters various situations in a forest.

They have two options in each situation: "Run" or "Climb the nearest tree."

If they choose to run, a random outcome (survival or death) occurs.

If they choose to climb a tree, they typically survive that encounter.

The game continues until the player dies or quits.

After the game ends, the player can choose to play again or exit.

It's a simple text-based game that demonstrates basic decision-making and looping in Python.
