# ROCK PAPER SCISSOR GAME 

The code first imports the random module, which will be used to randomly select the computer's choice. Then, it creates a list of the three possible choices for the user and the computer: rock, paper, and scissors.

The code then enters a loop that will run 10 times. In each iteration of the loop, the code prompts the user to enter their choice. The code then uses the random.choice() function to randomly select the computer's choice.

The code then checks for a tie. If the user and computer choose the same item, the game is a tie and neither player scores any points.

The code then checks for win conditions. If the user chooses rock and the computer chooses scissors, the user wins. If the user chooses scissors and the computer chooses paper, the user wins. If the user chooses paper and the computer chooses rock, the user wins. The opposite is true for the computer: if the computer chooses rock and the user chooses scissors, the computer wins. And so on.

Finally, the code prints the scores for the user and the computer. If the user has a higher score, the code prints "Congratulations! You won the game!" If the scores are tied, the code prints "The game is a tie!" If the computer has a higher score, the code prints "Computer won the game!"
